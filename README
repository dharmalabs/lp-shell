This is a quick prototype of a command line shell for Liquid Planner:
http://www.liquidplanner.com/

using their REST API:
http://www.liquidplanner.com/api-guide

It doesn't do much at this point other than:
- view your account information
- view tasks
- view comments
- view workspaces

A pickle file (.lp.pkl) is stored in $HOME. It's not encrypted in anyway
but is chmod'd 600. This file holds a username, password and
workspace id and can be changed with the 'a' command. If the file doesn't
exist, it will be created prompting for the username and password. To set
the active workspace, use the 'w' command.
